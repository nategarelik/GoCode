# Product Requirements Document: Styling System Overhaul

## Executive Summary

This PRD addresses the critical styling issues in the Claude Code UI application, specifically the CSS loading failures in Docker environments and proposes a comprehensive overhaul of the styling system to improve performance, maintainability, and developer experience.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues
1. **CSS Loading Failures**: CSS files fail to load properly in Docker environments due to nginx proxy configuration conflicts
2. **Large Bundle Size**: Current Tailwind CSS bundle is 20KB (compressed) with potential for optimization
3. **High Maintenance Overhead**: 1,528 className instances across 33 files make refactoring complex
4. **Docker Complexity**: Multi-stage builds and nginx proxy add unnecessary complexity for static asset serving
5. **Limited Type Safety**: No compile-time validation for className strings

### Root Causes
- Architectural mismatch between nginx static file serving and Express app serving
- Tailwind's utility-first approach leads to verbose HTML and maintenance challenges
- No build-time optimization for unused styles
- Lack of design system constraints leading to inconsistent styling

## Proposed Solution

### Recommendation: Migrate to UnoCSS

After comprehensive analysis, **UnoCSS** emerges as the optimal solution due to:

1. **Minimal Migration Effort**: Tailwind utilities work out-of-the-box
2. **Superior Performance**: Up to 200x faster build times
3. **Smaller Bundle Size**: On-demand generation produces minimal CSS
4. **Docker Compatibility**: Simpler build process with fewer dependencies
5. **Future-Proof**: Growing ecosystem with active development

### Alternative Considered: Panda CSS

If type safety is a critical requirement, **Panda CSS** offers:
- Full TypeScript integration
- Design system constraints via recipes
- Zero-runtime CSS generation
- Higher migration complexity but better long-term maintainability

## Technical Requirements

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Fix (Immediate)
1. **Docker Configuration**
   - Implement nginx reverse proxy fixes (already completed)
   - Simplify build pipeline
   - Remove dual-serving architecture

2. **CSS Loading Verification**
   - Ensure CSS loads correctly in all environments
   - Add automated tests for style loading
   - Monitor bundle size metrics

### Phase 2: Framework Migration (Week 1-2)

#### Option A: UnoCSS Migration (Recommended)

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Install and configure UnoCSS
   ```bash
   npm install -D unocss @unocss/reset
   npm uninstall tailwindcss @tailwindcss/typography
   ```

2. Configure UnoCSS with Tailwind preset
   ```js
   // uno.config.js
   import { defineConfig, presetUno, presetTypography } from 'unocss'
   import presetWind from '@unocss/preset-wind'
   
   export default defineConfig({
     presets: [
       presetWind(), // Tailwind compatibility
       presetTypography(),
     ],
     theme: {
       // Migrate existing theme configuration
     }
   })
   ```

3. Update build configuration
   - Replace Tailwind PostCSS with UnoCSS Vite plugin
   - Update CSS imports to use UnoCSS

4. Gradual migration approach
   - Keep existing utilities working
   - Progressively optimize high-traffic components
   - Add custom shortcuts for common patterns

#### Option B: Panda CSS Migration (Type-Safe Alternative)

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Install Panda CSS
   ```bash
   npm install -D @pandacss/dev
   npm uninstall tailwindcss
   ```

2. Define design system tokens
   ```js
   // panda.config.ts
   export default {
     theme: {
       tokens: {
         colors: { /* migrate from Tailwind */ },
         spacing: { /* standardize spacing */ }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Create component recipes
   ```ts
   // button.recipe.ts
   export const button = cva({
     base: { /* base styles */ },
     variants: {
       intent: { primary: {}, secondary: {} },
       size: { sm: {}, md: {}, lg: {} }
     }
   })
   ```

4. Migrate components systematically
   - Start with UI components library
   - Create recipes for common patterns
   - Leverage TypeScript for refactoring

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 3)

1. **Bundle Size Optimization**
   - Implement critical CSS extraction
   - Enable CSS code splitting
   - Add resource hints for faster loading

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track CSS bundle size in CI/CD
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals impact
   - Set performance budgets

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Create style guide documentation
   - Add Storybook for component development
   - Implement design tokens for consistency

2. **Learning Curve**: Mitigated by choosing familiar patterns (UnoCSS)
3. **Timeline Delays**: Mitigated by clear phase boundaries

## Decision Matrix

| Criteria | Current (Tailwind) | UnoCSS | Panda CSS |
|----------|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| Bundle Size | 20KB | ~8KB | ~10KB |
| Build Speed | Slow | Very Fast | Fast |
| Type Safety | None | None | Full |
| Migration Effort | N/A | Low | High |
| Learning Curve | N/A | Low | Medium |
| Ecosystem | Large | Growing | Growing |
