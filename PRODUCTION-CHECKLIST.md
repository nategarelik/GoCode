## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-Deployment Tasks

Before deploying to production, complete these tasks:

1. **Environment Setup**
   - [ ] Copy `.env.production.example` to `.env.production`
   - [ ] Generate strong JWT_SECRET (min 32 chars)
   - [ ] Generate strong SESSION_SECRET
   - [ ] Configure CORS_ORIGINS for your domain
   - [ ] Set up SSL certificates in `nginx/ssl/`

2. **Database Setup**
   - [ ] Set up production database (PostgreSQL recommended)
   - [ ] Configure DATABASE_URL in environment
   - [ ] Run database migrations
   - [ ] Set up database backups

3. **External Services**
   - [ ] Configure Redis for session storage
   - [ ] Set up monitoring service (New Relic/Datadog)
   - [ ] Configure email service for alerts
   - [ ] Set up log aggregation service

4. **Security Hardening**
   - [ ] Run security audit: `npm audit`
   - [ ] Review and update CSP policy
   - [ ] Configure firewall rules
   - [ ] Set up DDoS protection (Cloudflare)
   - [ ] Enable audit logging

5. **Performance Testing**
   - [ ] Load testing with expected traffic
   - [ ] Memory leak testing
   - [ ] WebSocket connection limits testing
   - [ ] API rate limit validation

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. Build Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t claude-code-ui:latest .
   ```

2. Run security scan:
   ```bash
   docker scan claude-code-ui:latest
   ```

3. Deploy with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
   ```

4. Verify health:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
   ```

5. Monitor logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f
   ```

## üìä Post-Deployment Monitoring

- Monitor error rates in logs
- Track API response times
- Watch memory and CPU usage
- Monitor WebSocket connections
- Review security alerts
- Check rate limit effectiveness

## üîÑ Maintenance Tasks

- Weekly security updates check
- Monthly dependency updates
- Quarterly security audit
- Regular backup verification
- Log rotation and cleanup
- Performance baseline updates

## üö® Incident Response

1. **High Error Rate**
   - Check error logs
   - Review recent deployments
   - Scale resources if needed
   - Enable maintenance mode if critical

2. **Security Incident**
   - Rotate all secrets immediately
   - Review access logs
   - Enable additional logging
   - Contact security team

3. **Performance Degradation**
   - Check metrics dashboard
   - Review slow query logs
   - Scale horizontally if needed
   - Optimize bottlenecks

## üìù Notes

- Always test in staging before production
- Keep backups of previous deployments
- Document any custom configurations
- Review this checklist before each deployment
- Update checklist based on lessons learned
